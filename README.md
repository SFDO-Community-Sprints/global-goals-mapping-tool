https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300

* Dream Solution which sparked this project

* Project Summary
    * What is the project?
    
To provide a mechanism through which our customers can provide progress towards the 17 UN Global Goals, whereby Salesforce can aggregate data to show the impact of customers.
    
#### What impact will this have on the Community?
    
(TBC)
    
#### How could this project be distributed into the Community? 
    
We believe this could be released to the community in 3 phases as described below. 
    
   * Crawl
    
A basic package with custom objects / custom settings / other which allows a customer to install the package into Salesforce - either stand alone or linked to one or more NPSP objects / Standard Salesforce objects (TBD)
    
   * Walk
    
A managed package on the app exchange which links to the SDG API,  has the facility for individual customers to volunteer to share their data with Salesforce via an online form
    
   * Run
    
The ability to push all reconciled data towards a central salesforce.org (http://salesforce.org/) system, which allows for reporting on a regional level across all customers.
    
#### Is this a new project, or one carried over from a prior sprint?
    
No, this is a new project, however we feel this could be included in future sprints for further development. 


#### What have you accomplish during this sprint?

We have defined the project, the phases, and user stories (See below). 
We made a start on the overall object diagram (Link to the folder here) 
We made a start on the phased object diagrams (Link to the individual files here)
